Description: This package implements interuppted time series analysis for both continuous and count outcomes, and quantifies the associated effect size, as described in Effect Size Quantification for Interrupted Time Series Analysis: Implementation in R for Covid-19 Research.
    The main functions fit an ITS regression model, and then use the fitted values and the model-based counterfactual values to quantify the effect size (Cohen's d for continuous outcomes and relative risk for count outcomes).
